## Reading Notes: Gettting the Gist of Git

### Version Control

Local -> Centralized -> Dsitributed -> Git

The above is the chronological flow of the ideas that led to Git from programmers storing previous versions of code on their own hard disks. Distributed version control systems are the most modern and secure ways to insure that code will be protected from loss. A *mirrored* repositroy allows for two secure storage locations for projects.

### Git

The current longevity of Git is a huge advantage. Because so many programmers already use the Git ecosystem, you can be confident that what you are learning and becoming familiar with will be applicable through at least the beginning to intermediate portion of your career.
