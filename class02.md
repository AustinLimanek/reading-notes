## Reading Notes

### Choosing a Text Editor

A text editor is where you can organize ideas and share information with others. When it comes to choosing a text editor
it is best to consider both personal preference and the objective of the project.

### The Command Line

On a mac, you can open the terminal through the dock. This is the easiest of the options if you access the terminal often.
However, there are other methods of accessing the terminal.

The prompt line is followed by colon. This is where you fill in commands for the terminal.

### Basic Navigation

`pwd` provides you wit the current location of the directory  
`ls` provids information on what is in the current location  

  -you can add both options and the location of the directory in question

 There are both relative and absolute paths. We can use:
 `cd` to change directory. "cd ~" alone will return the user to the home directory
