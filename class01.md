## Learning Markdown

#### Markdown Basic Syntax

The document nicely compares how the rendered output will appear while using both markdown and HTML. This is a great pedagogical tool
for someone like me who is learning both at the same time. Seeing both allows for:

1. Seeing what is possible in the language
2. Similarities and differences
3. Why one can be more applicable depending on the end goal

I could have also listed the above three items in an unordered list with either -, *, or +. However, mixing may not be the best idea.
Something that I didn't realize was a big focus were blockquote. In this summary the blockquote received it's own section. The output
is quite nice. 
  > We hold these truths

you can also use the strange backward half-quote symbol to have `code` on the page!


#### Mastering Markdown on GitHub

WOW!!! There are so many features in this mastering markdown file. I wish I had more time to explore all that is possible. 

In the mean time, here are a few of the cool things:

* You can add links
  -Old fashioned: another webpage
  -Section: Dynamic website
  -Relative: UI level 10 with website navigation for clients
* Images are handeled easily
* ***Lists*** as seen here *(pretty meta)*
* You can reference others, teams, and other pages
* Use footnotes to be legal and properly reference ideas, quotes, and code.
