## Reading Notes

### Expressions and Operators

The major focus of this reading was on arithmetic and comparison operators. In addition, truth tables were discussed in detail. Thesse three subjects are overlapping and are all used in functions and other `JavaScript` that uses conditional logic.

This is a very comprehensive article that coveres quite a bit of detail. This can act as a reference for moving forward as I develop more familiarity with conditional statements and when I begin to pursue more complex functions. However, a basic overview is that there are both unary and binary operators that have operands and an operator manipulating a set or operands. This can be as simple as adding two variables, or it can be deleting properties of an object.

### Loops

The concept of loops allow for a process to be repeated until a certain condition is met. All of the conditional logic that was discussed in the last section are used in these loop condiationals. There are eight different types of loops that are covered in this reading. In class, we only covered `while`and for `loops`. However, there are also `do...while`, `labeled`, `break`, `continue`, `for...in`, and `for...of`. Not all of these are loops on their own, but they are used to maximize the function of the loops.

><form name="selectForm">
>  <label for="musicTypes">Choose some music types, >then click the button below:</label>
><select id="musicTypes" name="musicTypes" multiple>
><option selected>R&B</option>
><option>Jazz</option>
><option>Blues</option>
><option>New Age</option>
><option>Classical</option>
><option>Opera</option>
></select>
><button id="btn" type="button">How many are selected?></button>
></form>

I would like to look further into this code during my break between 102 and 201. The java is on the reading below the above `html`.
