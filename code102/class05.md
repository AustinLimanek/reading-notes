## Reading Notes

### What is CSS

CSS is a language that is used to complement html by adding style to webpages. The specifications or "specs" are the documents that run in the background that define all the colors, fonts, location, and size of the elements in html. The `CSS` can be used to modify elements by using predefined function-like tools that achieve specific outputs. I assume the `CSS` language has a `JavaScript`-like language that actually achieves the outputs that can be used.

### How to Add CSS

`CSS` can be done using either inline or by creating a `style.css` file in a repository. The `CSS` file needs to be linked up to the `html` file to allow for them to communicate. You can use `class` and `id` attributes in tags to further customize the `html` code.

### CSS Color

The `color` property makes websites beautiful, or at least more intersting, to look at for the user. You can either type out the name of color in `CSS` or you can use RGBA or hexidecimal to define the color you would like for a certain tag in `html`. Luckily, `Visual Studio Code` allows for a hoverover enabled incode app that allows a programmer to select from an easel like display.
