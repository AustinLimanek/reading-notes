## Reading Notes

### JS Intro Paragraph

`JavaScript` allows for the website to come alive with interactivity and function.
> ... is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative ... styles.

The use of JavaScript appears to be much broader than just for the use of webpage development. 

### Input and Output in JS

This is an excellent domonstartion of how  `<script>` can be used to make a website more interactive. Gabor introduces `document.getElementById` and `<input>` where both allow for the web user to put their information into a text area to be saved as a variable. However, it seems the variable is actually the `id` of the `<input>` tag. I will need to read more about the difference at a later time.

### Variables

Variables can be defined using `var`, `let`, and `const`. `var` seems to be the most flexible, however, some say that it is being phased out (i'm not sure why this is). `let` allows for the variable to be defined as different strings or numbers, but also has the ability to change the `value` of that variable. Futhermore, there is also `const` which is not able to be changed once it is defined.

### How Computers Work - Playlist

All computers have the four major components: input, stora, processing, and output. Binary is the foundational langauge the relates semi-conductor states to a `1` or `0` representation. Binary is then defined meaning by computer languages that are organized in ways that allow for complex functionality. The `CPU` is the location that controls all the other parts of the computer. For example, circuits to do math and logic, portales, connections to memory, and follows a sequence of commands. The operating system mananges all the other software and dictates where they go in memory and when they have acces to the CPU. The operating system is constantly switching between different software continuously.
