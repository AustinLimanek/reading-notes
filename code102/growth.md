# Growth Mindset

[Journal Home](README.md)

What does growth mindset mean to *me*? It means identifying holes in my knowledge; asking questions, researching, and experimenting; and **sharing** my knowledge and passions with others!

## Reminders

- Keep asking questions when you either don't know something or are confused about something
- You are capable, intelligent, and able to learn anything!
- ***Talk with colleagues and peers*** about what they are working on and learning
