Hello, my name is Austin Limanek and I have just started my coding career at Code Fellows.

### Growth Mindset

What does growth mindset mean to *me*? It means identifying holes in my knowledge; asking questions, researching, and experimenting; and **sharing** my knowledge and passions with others!

#### Reminders

- Keep asking questions when you either don't know something or are confused about something
- You are capable, intelligent, and able to learn anything!
- ***Talk with colleagues and peers*** about what they are working on and learning

### Biography

I have a B.S. in **physics** from Western Washington University. I am currently a student at Code Fellows.
