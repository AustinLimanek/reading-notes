# My Reading Journal

Hello, my name is Austin Limanek and I have just started my coding career at Code Fellows.

### Growth Mindset

What does growth mindset mean to me? It means identifying holes in my knowledge; asking questions, researching, and experimenting; and share my knowledge and passions with others!

#### Reminders

- Keep asking questions when you either don't know something or are confused about something
- You are capable, intelligent, and able to learn anything!
- Talk with colleagues are peers about what they are working on and learning
