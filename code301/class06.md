## Reading Notes

### An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

1. Node.js works with Chrome technologies to allow for external packages to be integrated into other projects in a dynamic/asynchronous fashion.
2. The V8 is the parser that brings the Js code to something that the computer can actually understand and do something with. The information of js is broken down into 1s and 0s.
3. We can use the Node.js as a way to run the js code on our computers. The is where npm is used in partnership with react.
4. It is a package manager that is a repository of at least a million files stored and accessible through the npm library.
5. 18.5.0
6. 8.12.1
7. npm install -g jshint
8. Node is used for connecting with servers and uses libuv to execute most of the function under the hood for these purposes.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness.
2. Learning from fellow students. This seems to always be the case. My peers know so much that I don't know. When I do know something a little better than them, it is also a great opportunity for me to explain the material in a concise and approachable way.
3. You can either have on person 'drive' and the other person is in charge. However, you can also be both programming and discuss what each other are working on and what either one of them need help with.

### Things I want to know more about

Where do the servers exist that house the files that are in the Node.js and npm technologies. Who pays for these servers and how long are they going to be free to use by the average programmer free of charge?
