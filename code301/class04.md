## Reading Notes

### Forms

1. It allows the user to control the inputted value in a more dynamic way. The input can be updated with each keystroke or action. The value can be manipulated directly with js.
2. We should start processing the information as the user is typing into the input field. This allows for a more dynamic experience for the user.
3. We use the onChange to deal with the event.

### The Conditional Ternary Operator Explained

1. The major consequence is decreasing the amount of code that needs to be written.
2. `x === y ? console.log('true') : console.log('false')`

### Things I want to know more about
