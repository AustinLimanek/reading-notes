## Reading Notes

### Functional Programming

1. Functional programming is using immutable variables and having functions that have single inputs map to a deterministic output. Any one function is not effected by any other function.
2. A function is pure when the same input always has the same input.
3. Other functions will not depend on others. The benefits also come from the combination of the two features pointed out in number one. The combination is referential transparency.
4. The variable or definition does not change throughout out the algorithm or function.
5. Referential transparency is the combination of pure functions and immutable data. The same input than the same output. Consistent behavior. You know what you are going to get out.

`module.export = something`  and `require('/something)` allows for a function or variable to exist out of the scope of a single page of `js`. This can also be extended to reaching data from more external files.
