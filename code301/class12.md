## Reading Notes

### Status Codes Based on REST Methods

1. 
  -100: information error
  -200: when the action could not execute
  -300: The resources is not available to the server
  -400: Client side error
  -500: The server is the location of the error
2. The process has reached the point of acceptance but did not fully complete.
3. The current URL is not active any longer a new path is required.
4. 404 resource not found
5. 410 resources no longer exists
6. 403 the resource is not available to the client. Furthermore, there is no way for the client to validate their connection in order to access the file.

### Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MangoDB - Quick

1. We need to connect our server with the database that exists on the MongoDB servers.
2. It's a computer that is between the client and the end server.
3. app is the singleton of the script. This tells app to use the express library with the json extension.
4. This locates the id number of the search
5. Patch modifies the existing data that exists in that spot. Put replaces the data with new data, however similar.
6. You list the name of the key and then you input the data type of the future value, if it is filled.
7. This does not have one meaning it is a generic error message. Unexpected problem has occurred.
8. 200 means the request has been received and understood. 201 a new resource has been created on request.

### Things I want to know more about
