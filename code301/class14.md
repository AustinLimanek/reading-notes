## Reading Notes

### That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. In 1984 personal computers became available for the market place. The advertisements for these devices were targeted at boys and men. The article argues that these advertisements had the negative consequence of selecting for men to excel in the computer science field.
2. As with anything in life, exposure to technology and ideas at an early age provides an intuition over many hours of use. The boys and men who initially had the exposure to computers had developed an intuition of computer, just like girls and women who had this exposure. For the women and men who did not have exposure, there intuition of computers was thin to none. Thus, lack of exposure resulted in poorer performance in computer science courses. Due to advertising of computers in the mid-1980s, boys and men had a higher chance of getting or buying a personal computer. After this, the stereotype that computers are for boys was started. Having equal exposure to youth moving forward will allow for computer science to have more diversity in participants.

### Employee breakdown of key technology companies

1. Diversity is most successful when projects are centered around creativity and innovation.
2. When diversity is present there are more perspectives available and wider pool of experiences that can be pulled from.
3. There is wisdom in all groups and communities. This wisdom can be in the form of the lens at which someone looks at the world or how they confront adversity. When a product mindfully integrates diverse backgrounds it can approximate a more universal human interface.  

### Things I want to know more about

The chart attached to the current reading only goes until 2017, I wonder if there is an updated version of this table with the last several years? I addition, I wonder how Covid-19 impacted the ratio of men to women going into computer science?
