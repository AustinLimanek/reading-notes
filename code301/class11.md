## Reading Notes

### SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences Explained with few Example DB

| SQL | NoSQL |
| ---- | ------ |
| Schema | No set structure |
| Vertical expansion | Horizontal |
| Scalable to a point | Scalable |
| References common | References difficult |

1. Data that has the same schema for all entries. For example, each entry has exactly the same type of data for each entry.
2. Products that are listed throughout the website and the id is used to identify the each entry.
3. NoSQL is used for distributed systems that don't need the same schema. That is, each entry does not need an id.
4. Facebook, Twitter, and Google all use NoSQL for the massive amount of data that they take in on any given day. In addition API stores information in this way. Where documents are the websites that contain the json files.
5. NoSQL would be better for this application. For example, if one wanted to store data on generational data of an expanded family tree.
6. NoSQL is better for scalability purposes

### SQL vs NoSQL or MySQL vs MongoDB

1. Structured Query Language and Not Only SQL
2. Works with tables. An example is the product information.
3. Relational data structure for SQL.
4. Schema is a way information is organized. Relational databases have fields. All records have the same number of fields, whether or not that field is filled in or not. You can query connects between tables and their fields. Normalized distributed schema.
5. MongoDB is the most popular NoSQL database.
6. Collections organize the documents that are in an object format, in particular json format. There is no required schema. Documents do not need to have all the same structure.
7. A mongo database has collections and documents.
8. In a sense, NoSQL is more flexible because you don't need to follow the same schema from document to document. While in SQL there is a defined schema for the whole structure.
9. Data may exist in multiple locations. Thus, updating the data frequently can be difficult to manage. NoSQL is better for read ony application or infrequent rea applications. That is, with few writing events.
