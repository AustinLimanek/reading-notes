## Reading Notes

### How I explained REST to my brother

1. He was an early architect of the HTTP specification
2. Not all computers use verb that can be used more universally to all of the nouns that are used on computers around the world.
3. This is the network that moves files around the internet. This information can be pulled from by using API to access some of the useful information using simple methods.
4. Finds the url that the user is looking for. No mutation occurs with this verb.
5. Puts updates information to the internet so that other computers can pull that information. No mutation occurs with this verb.
6. Post creates a new resource that other users can pull from.
7. Patch is a summary of the new updates that the Put verb would carry out.

### API Keys

Do I have a key for these API technologies?

1. Geocoding API: YES
2. Weather Bit API: YES
3. Yelp API Docs: YES
4. The Movie DB API Docs: YES

### Things I want to know more about
All of these verbs seem very similar to operations that are done to array with the various methods in the JS library. These concepts, or verbs, are obviously simple but also fundamental to data storage and manipulation. It is no wonder that there are similarities between array methods and the http verbs.
