## Reading Notes

### API Design Best Practices

1. Representative State Transfer
2. resources are the main focus of this technology
3. Url is the main identifier. Like how we are using urls to look up data from API this is what is meant by identifier.
4. PUT, GET, POST, PATCH, And DELETE
5. It should be based on key properties from the resources that are being looked up by the user
6. http://www.hello.com/?smile=yes&activity=eatgoodfood&format=json
7. Chatty is bad, I mean... But in the context of API it is a resources that requires many retrievals because the data is stored in many layers. Each retrieval is expensive.
8. 200
9. 204 No content
10. 201 created
11. 204 No content, but in a good way

### Things I want to know more about

I am unsure what the third level is discussing. Is there a movement to normalize the way this level of organization is happening?
