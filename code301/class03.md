## Reading Notes

### React Docs - lists and keys

1. The output is an array
2. You put the JSX code in an anonymous function that will print out for each element or according to some conditional.
3. Unique Key
4. To catalog the information and be able to call back to the component in the future.

### The Spread Operator

1. It was introduced in 2016 with the update of ES6. It is a very simple concept but very powerful tool. `...`.
2. First: concatenate two arrays. Second: convert an NodeList into an array. Third: Extend the number of properties of an object. Fourth: Inject an array into another array.
3. You could use array1 and array2. `newArray = [...array1, ...array2]` would give the desired result.
4. New item a and array. `newArray2 = [a, ...array]`
5. Two objects thing1 and thing2. `newObject = {...thing1, ...thing2}`

### How to Pass Functions Between Components

1. The instructor returns a prop that has the function or method of the component object (5:45).
