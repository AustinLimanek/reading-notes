## Reading Notes

### Component-Based Architecture

1. It's a reusable unit in the React architecture that often fits into a decided functionality group and is separate, for the most part, from other components in the application design.
2. The characteristics in a way define what a component is. The component should be replaceable, extensible, independent, and reusable within the application architecture.
3. The principals of Reach allow for projects to be lighter weight and strives for dry code that emphasizes reuse and modularity.

### What is Props and How to Use it in React

1. Props in short for properties.
2. Props are similar to arguments in functions in other languages. However, they are objects and are read only.
3. Props flow from the parent to a child and not the other way around.
