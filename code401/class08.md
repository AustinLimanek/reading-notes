## Reading Notes

### Don't Repeat Yourself

A system should have a logical connection between instances of a concept. When there is a change, there is should be an easy to follow routine that can correct the system. In the best case, the design would allow for only one source of truth and have a very dry system.

### Rule of Three

Is a rule of thumb that suggest that programmers should consider refactoring their code if they find them selves writing the same code three times. This rule increases the maintainability of a codebase and helps mitigate errors when maintenance is being done.

### You Aren't Gonna Need It

It tends to be a good idea to plan for the future and to write code that will anticipate future needs. However, the YAGNI principle goes directly in the face of the assumption. Programmers such as John Carmack suggest that architecture that tries to anticipate future needs rarely ends with a net-positive. This means that one should only write code that is currently necessary for the desired functionality. Refactor when more information is obtained or when you learn that the refactoring actually needs to be done.

### Minimum Viable Product

This is a similar principle to the YAGNI principle. Don't write code that you may never need. In this case, only write code that you believe is fundamental to the user experience and see what users actually want to see improved on. This iterative practice allows for programmers to be more focused in their design and implementation.

    You're selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set to visionaries, not everyone.
