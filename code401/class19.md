## Reading Notes

### Functional Programming

Functional programming is in distinction from imperative programming. Java is typically thought of as an imperative programming language, however, in Java, you are able to write programmes that are functional programs. Furthermore, the actual definition, or distinction, between pure and impure functional programming can be quite controversial.

Mutable data types are commonly not part of the functional programming language. Instead, persistent data types are used. So languages also use data types that are classified as confluently persistent. This means that each previous version of a data type can be modified and even merged with any other version of that data type.

Some argue that functional programming allows for fewer bugs and easier debugging because functional programming only has functions that are deterministic. This is in distinction from imperative, where a method can be influenced by the state of the program.

## Things I want to know more about

- temporal logic
- program state
- mutable vs. immutable data structures
