## Reading Notes

### Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

Think about what types of data structures are compatible with the problem domain data. Now consider which one has the lowest complexity, or big O, for the given task. For example, a binary tree might provide a more efficient search than an array even thought they both could hold the same data.

2. How can we ensure that we'll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

You introduce a base case to the recursive function.
