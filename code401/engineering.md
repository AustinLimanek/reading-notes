## Reading Notes

### Questions

What's the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

A creativity in bringing together diverse fields into software projects. I enjoy brainstorming new products and how they could impact the future.

What are 3 things I'll start doing to "un-stick" myself whenever I get stuck on tough pieces of code, logic, or feature?

1. Break the problem down into manageable parts and think through those bits.
2. Ask others for their perspectives on the problem
3. Step away for five-ten minutes and think about the problem from a distance or think about something different all together. Allow my subconscious work on the problem.
