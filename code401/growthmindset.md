## Reading Notes

### Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

Browan argues for the continuous expanding of technical skills. However, he makes sure to define new technical skills as a topic that challenges you to the point of mental exhaustion upon completion. This would include learning topics such as new algorithms, new mathematics concepts, and fundamentals of computer science such as optimization protocols. He distinguishes this from learning additional NoSQL database or JS frameworks. He argues that we practice only when we deep dive into a specific skill that we need to improve on.  

### Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

The power of yet. Some students had a growth mindset and the approached a problem with an exciting opportunity to expand their understanding. Growth mindset also expands students to be more interested in being challenged. Students who did not have the growth mindset would look to someone who did more poorly than them or would consider cheating the next time.

The yet and growth mindset is particularly powerful for students that historically struggle the most. When this concept is taught, these students out perform their peers who were not taught this mindset.

### Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

Which people are able to learn in difficult situations? This is the question that Duckworth was trying to answer with her question. Her answer is Grit, which is having passion and sticking with something for the long-term and not for the short-term understanding or reward. This reminds me of the marshmallow test that was done in the 70s.

She concluded with the pithy statement that we need to by gritty about making our students and children more gritty. This of course applies to ourselves as learners. We need to realize that learning is a journey and the more that we struggle and spend time on a subject, the more time our brains have to integrate these new perspective and paradigms into neural connections.

### Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

Botton had an excellent intro to his speech. He started in a humours and witty way that immediately convinced me that I wanted to continue hearing what he had so share. His overall message is to find when you really consider as success and to not define that solely on what those around us see a valuable. This message resonates when reflecting on the several topics that he discusses throughout his talk. For example, the dinner party question, the view of a materialistic world, the envy we feel at a reunion. Each of these is a measure of relative success. He argues that this is not healthy. It is impossible to be successful at all aspects of life. Work-life balance is impossible and a meritocratic society is naive. Their are simply to many complicating variables.

### Emotional Intelligence

My scores were all above the 18 mark, however, this is by definition a subjective test. This test was more helpful in the sense that it gave me a time to reflect on aspects of my actions and way of perceiving that I could work on to improve my emotional intelligence. I could see my score changing in each section by a few points up or down depending on my mood, which probably feeds into self-management being my lowest score on the EI score. Ultimately, I consider myself fairly introspective and I also find it important to reflect on previous interactions with colleagues, loved ones, or strangers well after the interaction has ended.

### Biases

Which of the areas is your strongest?

I am fairly aware of what bias and how our brains use them as heuristics to decrease neural computations. However, this does not mean that this is a "good" or even the most efficient thing for us. Being aware of common biases can help us recognize and mitigate them the best we can.

Which of the areas is your weakest?

I suppose acting is my weakest spot. However, I assume this slot is low because of my response to not finding ways to help my community or decreasing bias in my work environment. The latter is because I have not been in a work environment for a long time. On the former, I actually do a good amount of mentoring through tutoring, but this is not in a businesses setting.

Which of the areas will you focus on in the coming weeks and beyond?

Finding some way that I can reach out to some community to improve my out reach so that I can make a change in the world outside of me.

### Things I want to know more about

I would like to learn about opportunities that I could participate in to increase the public awareness of the downsides of bias.
