## Reading Notes

### Spring App Basics

This article covers the setup and process of doing basic customization to to a basic Spring application by using their Github repository as a starting point. Either Gradle or Maven can be used for the build automation tool. No actual `html` or `css` need to be written in order for the basic "Hello, World" or "Hello, User" application to function. There is an additional ability for the user to type a query into the url to put in their desired name to get a personal message on their 8080 port.

### Spring MVC and Thymeleaf

MVC: Model View-Controller. This reading shows several examples of how to successfully implement a Thymeleaf `@Controllers`. In addition, it further discusses how attributes, parameters, and Spring beans work in the Spring MVC system.

It is important to note that when the number of parameters is greater than one then values are accessed by a serialized array.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to view some project examples using Spring MVC and Thymeleaf. The website provided only include the inputs and how the templates are constructed but not how they look.
