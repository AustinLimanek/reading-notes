## Reading Notes

### Review: High-level HTTP

This article covers in detail the process of sending out a request to a url from a computer and how exactly data is being transported at every step of the process. This article is worth re-reading several times to un-peel the layers that is the WRRC in full generality and not on the level of any one programming language. There are many acronyms to keep track of throughout the discussion. The author mentions that the HTTP request lifecycle is asked about frequently during technical interviews.

### Java HTTP Request example

This article is more focused on the java specific side of the HTTP request cycle. Specifically, a Spring 5 library is used to carry out the major functions of the HTTP cycle. The steps of creating a request, setting request parameters, headers, configuring timeouts, handling cookies, redirects, responses, handing failed requests, and finally building the full response. There are code examples that are provided for each of these steps. Again, this article is a great reference for when a HTTP request cycle is being coded.

## Things I want to know more about

HTTP request cycle specifically in the java environment.
