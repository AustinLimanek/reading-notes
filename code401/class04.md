## Reading Notes

### Java OO Tutorial (only the Object and Class ones)

Objects have both state and behavior. Objects are used to model the real world, but inside of a program, such as Java.

Objects are instances of class. Class is where the methods and properties are located. Class is just a blue print of an object. The actual object is something that the code can interact with and manipulate.

### Java Classes (do Not do the Nested Classes section

Classes can have fields, constructors, and methods inside the class declaration. Furthermore, you can use `extends` to allow for a subclass to inherit methods and fields from the parent class. It is possible to do method overloading by defining multiple methods with the same name but with different input declarations. The method with the correctly defined input will be called upon in the class.

Constructors do not have a return type. The `new` keyword is used to invoke the declaration of an instance of the class, which is an object.

### Binary, decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

Values can be represented using an base one decides. For example, in measurement, we have the meter and the foot. Inches to feet are base 12: 5'11'' is a way of writing base twelve, but the ticks represent where the digits of the base twelve start and end. 5 does not represent 50, even thought it is in the second place, instead it represents 5x12 = 70". This is a much more complicated base system than the metric system, which is base ten.

## Things I want to know more about

Fields seem to have been thrown into the discussion without being addressed directly. This is a term that I would like to know more about.

Nested classes: are these different or the same as subclasses?
