## Reading Notes

### Wireframe and Design

Wireframing is the process of laying out a website without explicitly referencing code. This is the first step in working for a client or drafting ideas for your own project. Either paper or software such as `InVision` and  `Balsamiq` can be used.

Sketching or Wireframe should be the first step while programming. Then second drafts can be a more detailed iteration of the wireframe already constructed. The final step is the actual coding. This suggestion will save time by not doing unneeded code that may not be used in the end product.

### Mozilla HTML Basics

There are tags that can either be empty or require content between opening and closing tags. For tags such as: head, body, header, main, footer, and p they all have content that exists inside their opening anc closing tags. The closing tag has a forward slash to distinguish it from the opening tag. Tags will often nest inside other tags to allow for structure and organization.

In addition to the basic content tags, empty tags such as img was discusses. Img is where images are sourced and discribed. There is no content that will show besides the actual sourced image, thus the html coding will be done all within the open-only tag. Attributes can be added to many of the tags. These attributes help specify and further utalize other features for a website or project.

### Semantics

The concept of semantics defines the function of a tag or function. The name that will be pointed to should be desciptive so that other programmers, parsers, and compilers can have a general idea of what is in the source code. There are roughly 100 different types of semantic elements in html. Some of them such as head, body, p are all familiar. However, there are a few I was unfamiliar with such as aside, figcaption,mark, and time. Although I don't know exactly what these elements do, since these elements are semantic, then I have a pretty good idea what they do. This is a very important feature of a programming language and feeds into usability.
