## Reading Notes

### Wireframe and Design

Wireframing is the process of laying out a website without explicitly referencing code. This is the first step in working for a client or drafting ideas for your own project. Either paper or software such as `InVision` and  `Balsamiq` can be used.

Sketching or Wireframe should be the first step while programming. Then second drafts can be a more detailed iteration of the wireframe already constructed. The final step is the actual coding. This suggestion will save time by not doing unneeded code that may not be used in the end product.
