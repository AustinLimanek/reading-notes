## Answers to Questions

HTML

1. We use the `<a>`, anchor tag
2. The url of the website to be linked
3. Using clear language for the actual textContent of the tag

CSS

1. This is the default way that browsers will interpret the html language in combination with JS and CSS DOM information. If a developer wants to change this, they have the ability to do that.
2. Block-level takes up a whole new line. The inline puts the content as close as possible to other inline elements.
3. Static is the default positioning value of the position attribute. Other values such as relative, absolute, and fixed will change how the elements flow in the html document.
4. Absolute allows for very exact positioning of an element and keeping it at that location throughout scrolling. This can be nicely used for the header tag.
5. Relative is respect to where it would be if only static positioning was active.

JS
