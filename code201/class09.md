## Reading Notes

### Web Forms

This is a highlevel overview of the types of material that should be covered to get an understanding of how forms work in `HTML` and eventually how it interacts with `JavaScript`.

### Your first form

A descirption of the types of adjustments that can be made to the basic form tag were provided. For example, the email input ensures that the user input will actually be an email. In addition, content can be sent to another location so that it may be stored. A button is a great way to activate the process of sending the user input to the new destination.

### How to structure a web form

This reading expands off of the previuos reading by going into more detail on the already presented structure and functionality of the form tag. However, it also introduced the sytax that forces the user to input data into a given field before submission.

### JavaScript - Dynamic Client-side scripting

This article, like the first article in this assigned reading, is an overview of many topics that can be read about. In this case the overview is JS and discusses content that we have covered earlier in the class.

### Introduction to events

Events are inputs by the user to initiate a response from the webpage that has been programmed into the HTML, CSS, and/or JS. The button is a basic example that takes information in when a client clicks on the button. Any action can result from the click of a button, as long as it is programmed. EventListener was also discussed, which is looking for an event to occur until a given action occurs.
