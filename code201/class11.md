### A Complete Guide To Grid

This pages lays out the many grid properties that can be used when formatting with CSS. The container, which holds the content to be manipulated has its own necessary properties, while the children of that parent also have there own properties to be enabled for a desired effect. The grid allows for precision placement by using a concept of spanning blocks across a predefined grid that can be manipulated. The commands are very similar to flex, but the effects are different in this context. The grid exists within the parents and the children exist on that grid.
