## Reading Notes

### What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

The developer went through code for a basic quessing game and some common errors that might occur for such a project. The developer stated that the most common errors are related to either syntax or logic errors. He eluded to the fact that as one gains more experience other errors are common, but for those early in their career, these are the most common. I have certainly had a lot of the same issues that he covered in this article. I also learned that while in the browser rendering of the webpage, the error message has the syntax low:character of the issue. I hadn't put it together that the second number was for the character count.

### The JavaScript Debugger

This article coveres many features of the developer tools that are available on major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Some of the features include the ability to:

* Removing code from the webpage by clicking the checkmarks to preview what not having this line would do to the page
* Box model of any HTML element: which shows padding, border, and margin
* Console that shows outputs of `console.log()' and a view of the errors that have occured
* An ability to apply breakpoints to see what the webpage would look like if the remaining components after the breakpoint were not loaded

These were freatures that I were aware of, but the author supplemented my understanding of these freatures greately. However, I still don't know how to effectively use the breakpoint feature of the developer tools. I will have to explore this at a later time.

### Things I want to know more about

How are breakpoints used?
