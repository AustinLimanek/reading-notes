## Reading Notes

### HTML Text Fundamentals

This article summarizes the many ways that html can handle sections of text. The article discusses headings, list (both ordered and non), paragraphs, as well as inline tags such as strong, emphasis, underline, italicization, and a combination of them.

### HTML Advanced Text Formatting

Some more tags are explored in the article. For example, the abbr and time tags were discussed in detail and what attributes can be used to more fully take advantage of these tags. Furthermore, the dl, dt, and dd tags were introduced.
